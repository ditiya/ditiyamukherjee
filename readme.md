# OCR using android studio during internship with NITAP

I, Ditiya , present a code that reads the text invoved in an image and gives output of what is written in it.
# Process 
This first divides the image into multiple parts(each part has a single character and can read printed as well as handwritten texts in english! 
 
 Hopefully the code is self explanatory.
