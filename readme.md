# OCR using Python and Tesseract during internship with NITAP

I, Ditiya , present a code that reads the text invoved in an image and gives output of what is written in it.
# Process 
This first divides the image into multiple parts(each part has a single character). 
 
 Hopefully the code is self explanatory.
#Dataset
The Dataset I am using is  [NIST](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-srd/SD19/by_class.zip) Dataset
